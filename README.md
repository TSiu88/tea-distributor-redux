## Description

This application is the Week 17 Friday independent assignment for Epicodus' full time Intro to Programming and C#/React course. This is an application made in the previous week to show a React application which has been refactored so that all states use Redux and includes testing, action creators, and action constants.  A component diagram is also to be included to show the structure of the components.

This application is for a tea shop or distributor to keep track of their stock of teas.  It has details on what they tea is named, type, country of origin, price, amount in stock, and a picture for each tea.  Then a button can be clicked on the main page to decrease the stock by one as they are sold.  A single tea's details along with ID number can be seen on a details page.  More teas can be added and require a name, price, and amount minimum to create.

## Specifications

### User Stories
<details>

  - [ ] As a user, I want the option to edit a tea's properties after entering them just in case I make a mistake.
  - [ ] As a user, I want to be able to delete a tea.
  - [x] As a user, I want a tea to update to say "Out of Stock" once it's empty.

  - [ ] As a user, I want to have teas prices to be color-coded for easy readability. This could be based on their price, the style of beer or kombucha, or the amount of tins left.
  - [ ] As a user, I want this application to be nicely styled. (Use stylesheets and CSS objects!)
